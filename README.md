Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project-using-POWERBI-and-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using SQL for data extraction, transformation, and validation, and Power BI for interactive visualization and reporting.

SQL queries are used to clean, aggregate, and derive key loan metrics, while Power BI dashboards present insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayment status, interest rates, and borrower risk profiles. The report enables clear analysis of loan performance and portfolio health through dynamic filters and visuals.
